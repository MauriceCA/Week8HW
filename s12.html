        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>Once Maurice told Corey she wanted a car to match his, he was on a mission. Unfortunately, 240's have been affected by the inflation and are extremely expensive right now.
        They were now on a mission to find the next best thing. Maurice had a few criteria she wanted for her car. First, the car needed to have pop-up headlights. 
        Second, the car needed to be as cool or cooler than Corey's 240sx. Third, the car needs to be automatic. And finally, the car couldn't be something that was
        either going to be a nightmare to work on or be difficult to find parts for. Fast forward to late 2022, Corey finds the 200sx in Los Alamos, NM. The car
        is not currently in running condition, needs a little bit of body work, a new paint job, and some interior TLC, but all were thought to be doable. 
        <br>
        Now, they found the car, and so begins the hard work. Number one priority is to see if they can get the car to run. Parts for the engine will be needed. 
        Specifically, a harmonic balancer. After a trip to the junkyard and finding a one that was <em>supposed</em> to fit but didn't (the internet lied). Corey
        began pulling out parts under the hood that were no longer going to be needed and discovered oil in the lower radiator hose. YIKES. That means the engine
        in that car is no good. Now begins the hunt for a new engine!
        Read more about what parts they plan on using for this car below.
