        Maurice just got her 200sx in late 2022. It is an "in progress" project car. But then again, aren't all 
        projects cars always "in progress"? Read more on <a href="s12.html">Maurice's 200sx</a>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Corey and Maurice have been a couple for 5 years, but have been friends for over 15 years! Corey, with a soft spot for S Chassis, has owned at least four 240's. 
            Maurice, not being a person who was super into cars, thought it would be a fun idea and project for both of them to each have a car that they can drive around
            together and go to car meets in. This started the search for a car for Maurice and eventually lead to them acquiring the 200sx.
            The couple currently resides in Albuquerque, NM.
