        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
            In August of 2012, Corey bought his current 240sx in Taos, NM. Minor modifications were made on the car but in April 2020, the water pump on his
            KA24e engine exploded. Prompting the idea to do an engine swap. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Corey started and completed his engine
            swap, repainted his car exterior and engine bay, and put new wheels on the car. <br>
            Read the list of modifications that were done to this 240sx below.
